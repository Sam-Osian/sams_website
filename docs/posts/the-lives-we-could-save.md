**How do we spot the same deadly mistakes before they happen again?**

Prevention of Future Deaths (PFD) reports shine a light on the risks that cost lives across England and Wales. But while each report warns of a specific danger, there’s been no easy way to see the bigger picture — to spot recurring patterns and systemic failings hiding in plain sight. 

PFD Toolkit changes this. For the first time, researchers and analysts can screen reports for relevant cases, identify recurring themes, and pull out structured data from the written reports — all in a matter of minutes.

Here’s a grim truth: every year in England and Wales, coroners find that systemic safety issues play a part in hundreds of preventable deaths. By "systemic," we mean risks that could lead to further deaths if nothing changes — problems that likely go beyond an isolated mistake.

When a coroner uncovers this preventable death, they write what's called a **Prevention of Future Deaths** (or _PFD_) report. These PFD reports aren't subtle. They're blunt, often painfully so. Each report reflects a wholly unique tragedy but each are linked by a common sentiment: _"This could happen again, unless action is taken."_

PFD reports are sent to whoever the coroner deems best placed to act, be that a hospital, NHS Trust, Governmental Minister, or some other person or organisation.

Now, you might naturally assume — as I did — that there must be some kind of centralised function for learning from these reports. Some way of connecting the dots, and translating all of these collective warnings into real, national action. After all, if the same problems are cropping up again and again, surely someone, somewhere, is tracking them?

But, shockingly, there isn’t. Each PFD report exists more or less in isolation, fired off to the relevant authority and quietly filed away. There’s no reliable function or system for gathering similar reports together, sifting through them for recurring issues, or making sure the lessons actually filter into policy.

This problem hasn't gone unrecognised. Governmental and Parliamentary reports have referred to this system as ['under-developed' for public safety](https://committees.parliament.uk/publications/6079/documents/75085/default/) and that reports are ['under-utilised'](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/hillsborough-disaster-report-government-response/a-hillsborough-legacy-the-governments-response-to-bishop-james-jones-report-accessible). Perhaps [The Times](https://www.thetimes.com/comment/the-times-view/article/the-times-view-on-coroners-reports-warnings-unheeded-0qpb6phdx) said it best:

> So it is that Britain allows the opportunity to save thousands of lives to slip by.
