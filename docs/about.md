# About me

```
Hiya :)
```

I’m Sam Osian _(pronounced osh-ahn)_, an AI doctoral researcher currently based in the University of Liverpool. My main focus is currently on understanding what we can learn from coronial data, with the aim of translating evidence into practical tools for researchers, as well as those on the front lines of care.

Above all, I’m driven by the belief that tools and data, when shared and understood, can help prevent harm and improve care. Because of this, I'm an avid lover of open source. I’m especially interested in building community-led projects — resources that anyone can scrutinise, adapt, and put to work.
