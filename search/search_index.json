My main focus is currently on understanding what we can learn from coronial data, with the aim of translating evidence into practical tools for researchers, as well as those on the front lines of care.</p> <p>Above all, I\u2019m driven by the belief that tools and data, when shared and understood, can help prevent harm and improve care. Because of this, I'm an avid lover of open source. I\u2019m especially interested in building community-led projects \u2014 resources that anyone can scrutinise, adapt, and put to work.</p>"},{"location":"publications/","title":"Content coming soon! \u2728","text":""},{"location":"2024/05/01/hello-world/","title":"Hello World","text":"<p>Welcome to the first post on Sam's Blog.
